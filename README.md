# Mi-Pi

is a scalable microscopy system for Raspberry Pi. Here we include software and hardware documentation for building Mi-Pi. The hardware for each individual system costs ~$200, and each system is capable of continuous video capture and motion detection. We use this system to scale up behavior collection and analysis of the small model organism *C. elegans*.
