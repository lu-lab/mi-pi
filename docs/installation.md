# Software Installation

Once you have constructed the physical aspects of the system, you're ready to install software. We strongly recommend using the provided image of the system instead of installing required packages yourself, but we have provided a list of required dependencies.

## Raspberry Pi
Assuming you're using the system image, everything's basically already set up. If you would like to use the most up-to-date version of the software, you can pull the most recent version from GitHub. Note that this isn't necessarily stable, although we'll do our best. 
First, open a terminal and switch into the mi-pi directory:

        cd ~/mi-pi
2. Then, also in the terminal, type: 

        git pull origin master
Your software should now be up-to-date!
